# MCMC
Final Project for CIS 1051 and MATH 4096; an exploration and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo

This project allowed me to explore libraries such as numpy, scistats, and matplotlib to generate graphs and perform calculations. I also was able to implement the library collections to form an ordered dictionary. Normally dictionaries are unordered, so the ability to use this tool was quite helpful.

Unfortunately, I was not fully able to explore PyMC3, a MCMC specific library that allowed for complex MCMC computations. In hindsight, this was simply too ambitious of a project for myself to undertake as I do not currently possess the time nor the knowledge of Python to implement such a complex example. I hope to furhter explore computer science in the future as I greatly enjoyed working in depth with such a complex topic by breaking it down into its component parts. After this project, I feel as I have a very healthy grasp on MCMC as a concept. I also feel as if I greatly increased my knowledge and capabilities in Python.
