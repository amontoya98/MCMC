# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

An Introduction into Markov Chain Monte Carlo

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be exploring Markov Chain Monte Carlo through simplistic programming in Python.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be creating multiple programs that will serve as examples to explain Markov Chain Monte Carlo. I will first provide simplistic examples of both a Monte Carlo approximation and a Markov Chain. 
Then, I will be providing two simplisitc examples of MCMC applications before delving into a more complex example.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

This project is done in conjunction with Math 4096. The Python code is geared more toward 1051, while the write up of the mathematical processes are geared more toward 4096.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will MOST DEFINITELY create three small programs, one for Monte Carlo, one for Markov Chains, and one for MCMC. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I believe I will be able to accomplish all I wish to do before the project deadline

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best case scenario is I am able to implement a more complex exapmle of MCMC and generate meaningful graphs using python to analyze the results.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My most daunting task is to be able to implement PyMC3. I need to do more research into the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and I need to learn how to generate graphs in Python
