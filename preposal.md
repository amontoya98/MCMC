#Preproposal - Markov Chain Monte Carlo

#This project will explore Markov Chain Monte Carlos (MCMC) as a way of approximating probability
#This project will count for both CIS 1051 and MATH 4096
#This project will consist of a write up on MCMC and an implementation into python

#I will be working along

#I still do not know what to use as my mock data set, nor which library to implement
#Libraries in consideration: PyMC3, numpy, scipy
